Abstract:

This chapter leverages extensive survey data collected during the 2008-2010 period in order to understand whether individuals, from different economic circumstances and who might have been differentially affected by the Recession, respond similarly or differently to these economic shocks. The chapter describes how rich and poor voters responded to the economic crisis of 2008–2010 drawing on data from two panel studies conducted during the 2009 German Federal election and the 2010 U.K. Parliamentary election.
